=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelFilter::DragDest -- drag destination mix-in for TreeModelFilter subclasses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyNewFilterModel;
 use Gtk2;
 use base 'Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelFilter::DragDest';

 use Glib::Object::Subclass
   Gtk2::TreeModelFilter::,
   interfaces => [ 'Gtk2::TreeDragDest' ];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelFilter::DragDest> provides the following two functions
to implement the C<Gtk2::TreeDragDest> interface in a sub-class of
C<Gtk2::TreeModelFilter>.

    ROW_DROP_POSSIBLE
    DRAG_DATA_RECEIVED

They're designed as a multiple-inheritance mix-in, so you put
C<Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelFilter::DragDest> in your C<@ISA>, then add
C<Gtk2::TreeDragDest> to the C<interfaces> in your C<use
Glib::Object::Subclass> (or C<register_object>).

For simple filter draggability you'll probably find
C<Gtk2::Ex::TreeModelFilter::Draggable> enough, but C<DragDest> lets you add
draggability to sub-sub-classes of TreeModelFilter.

=head2 Drop

The drop strategy is simply to delegate to the filter's C<child-model>.  If
it's not a TreeDragDest, but is another C<Gtk2::TreeModelFilter>, then its
C<child-model> is tried, and so downwards to the first TreeDragDest capable
child.  The destination path position is converted as necessary.

If the drag source is the filter itself (which is usual for say dragging in
a C<Gtk2::TreeView>) then the source row ends up being from the first
non-filter child model.  The above drop stragegy ends up on that same child,
which is important for instance for a C<Gtk2::ListStore> since it only
allows drags within itself.

=head1 OTHER NOTES

There's probably no reason C<GtkTreeModelFilter> itself couldn't do this
sort of drop, but as of Gtk 2.12 it doesn't.  Perhaps by the time you read
this it will, and you won't need this code.

If your filter's "visible" function decides a newly dropped row shouldn't
appear then the drop still works, but it'll look to the user like the source
just disappeared.  That might be confusing; or if the destination is some
designated "hidden track" then it be what you want.
