Description: DragDest add-on for TreeModelFilter in Gtk2-Perl
 Gtk2-Ex-TreeModelFilter-DragDest adds the TreeDragDest interface to
 GtkTreeModelFilter objects.  As of Gtk 2.12 a filtered model is a
 drag source, but not a drag destination.  With DragDest you can drag
 and drop to re-order rows in a TreeView.
